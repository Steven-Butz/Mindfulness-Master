# Mindfulness-Master

This is a beta version of an iOS app that integrates HealthKit data with Calendar data in order to schedule 5- or 10-minute mindfulness meditation sessions at times in the day when you are predicted to be the most stressed (based on historical HRV data), and have a gap in your schedule.

Check out Demo branch for a functional demo with dummy HRV data and Calendar events.
